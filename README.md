# MACHINE LEARNING TOP ALGORITHMS SERIES
**
The purpose of the series is to implement the top basic Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch using Python in order to get complete undestanding of each algorithm.

Each algorothm implemented use a simple example to demostrate and test correct implementation, then a dataset and or an application of the algorithm is presented. A comparation using `sklearn` library is also used to comper the accuracy of the customize algorithm.
